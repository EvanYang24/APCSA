# Focus and Habits
- I Had taken away that I need to avoid depression because it is not good
- Like in the video it had explained how College students get depressed often and I had compared that to Del Norte in how many of our students get depressed as well.
- I had believed that this is such a big problem that I had decided to try to major in psychology and at least taking AP Psychology in highschool.
