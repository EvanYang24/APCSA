(3,4,7,12,19,28,39) is incorrect as the function is k times k then add 3, by inputting 0 first it would give the input as 3, then 1 -> 4, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 12, ..., 6 -> 39.

(4, 7, 12, 19, 28, 39) is correct since the code statement prints out 6 as N and that the code increments by 1 till the number is larger than N, in this case it being 6 it must start at one then reach till 6 and since it runs in a loop it goes six times and cannot go a 7th. Then 1 -> 4, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 12, ..., 6 -> 39.

Next time in order to get this question right, I can look at the videos to study or I could read some articles that were suggested by college board in order to prep for the AP exam.

This decleration that I chose, only Student b = newStudent("Juan", 15); is incorrect as it doesnt only include this since II is correct but so is choice I, Choice I uses no parameters so it can create a new object and assign it to any variable. 

Answer C, or Choice I and II is correct for all the reasons I gave for Choice I but Choice II uses a two-parameter constructor which paired with the orders of the string and int creates a new object and assigns it to a new variable.

The Videos given to us are very helpful as they are given from the AP website itself so not only does it prep us for this class but for the Exam as well. It provides three different videos allowing for the mastery of instantiantion of objects.

My answer being A) was wrong as the formatting and syntax was incorrect. By not including a dot it doesnt allow for the calling of non-static methods to use the parameters. (getMileage(v))

Refering to the answer above, doing so, the method doesnt have any parameters and will allow for the return of the milage for the variable v. Since its using a loop to access each element, the Vehicle object v is assigned to each one and to check the mileage for each vehicle it needs to be called which is now known for including a dot operator. (v.getMileage())

By refering to the four different videos mentioned in the related videos this can intensely prep me for all of the interface and class declaration problems to come.

I had chosen D, n will sometimes be greater than 2 at // Point C as my answer. This is incorrect as at Point C the variable n will be <= 2 and when n is greater than 3 the while loop will iterate at a decline until it has a value of 2.

The correct answer E, n will always be greater than 2 at // Point B, is correct since as stated above when n is greater than 2 the while loop will iterate and during this time, n will always be greater than 2.

This time, there was a question that was refrenced in the review portion, I could use all of these tools to boost my learning and if 3 videos and one other practice problem wont do the job then researching and finding more practice problems, watching youtube videos, and etc. 

ALL TOOLS USED TO EXPLAIN ARE IN THE SCREENSHOT.
